Bach's 6 Organ Sonatas are often regarded as a encyclopedia of trio playing for
the organist, and many have commented that mastering them is a sure-fire way to
a solid organ technique. They are indeed deceptively difficult, and one of my
organ teachers once commented that they would never perform such trecherous
pieces in public!

This opening movement is delightfully bubbly, moving seemingly without a care in
the world â€” while the organist mentally holds on for dear life!
