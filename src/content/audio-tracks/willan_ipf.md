The sprawling Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue of Willan has long been a
crowning jewel in the organ repertoire. It is a fantastic piece to showcase both
organ and organist; it's dense texture and variations allow ample opportunity to
explore the full tonal resources of the organ.

According to the composer, he composed each of the passacaglia variations while
commuting on a trolley car from downtown Toronto to Lake Simcoe, where he had
been vacationing for the summer in 1916.
