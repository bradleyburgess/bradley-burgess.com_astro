There have been several artistic works inspired by the Paul Verlaine poem
entitled, “Clair de Lune” _(“Moonlight”)_. The most famous musical work in this
category is obviously the piano work by Claude Debussy, but there is also a song
by Fauré and this organ setting by Vierne.

Interestingly enough, all the pieces share a key signature: the Debussy and
Vierne are in D♭ major, and the Fauré is in the related B♭ minor. The Vierrne
comes 20 years after the Debussy, and it has a markedly different atmosphere;
the Debussy seems brighter somehow, while the Vierne has a more ethereal,
timeless quality, owing to the static accompaniment and long, sliding melodies.
