Rautavaara is not a well-known composer in the west, but he has garnered much
acclaim, especially for his wonderful choral works. You can hear his fondness
for cluster chords in this toccata. The version I play is the earlier version;
Rautavaara having cut the piece down a little and thinning the texture in some
places. It's not often that I choose to play an original version of a piece if a
composer has reworked it, but I really do feel the earlier version is more
effective.
