Messiaen was a devout Catholic, and many of his organ works have overtly and
deeply religious connections. This exciting piece is from Messiaen's suite,
_The Ascension_, which contains four depictions of Christ's ascension into
heaven. Originally for orchestra, Messiaen also arranged the suite for organ,
but decided to write a new third movement for the organ version — this being
that new movement. It has since become a staple in the organ virtuoso's
repertoire.

One can definitely hear the “outbursts” from the very opening. The piece
certainly tests the organist's manual technique, and culminates in a dizzying
cascade of notes that closes the movement.
