The beautiful second movement has an introspective quality to it. Because Bach
gives no indication for registration beyond the assumption that you'll use two
manuals, the organist is free to choose the colors of the solo voices. For this
recording, I decided to keep it simple, and choose a flute and a quintadena â€”
the quint giving that lovely fifth overtone color to the second voice.
