Vierne is a towering figure in the French organ school, and with this finale
from the first organ symphony, it's easy to see why his music has been popular
with audiences, too. The earlier works are certainly more conservative
harmonically, this symphony being an example of that.

The finale is undoubtedly one of the most popular pieces in the organ  
repertoire, and I've used it on several recital programs and often as a festive
postlude. It is a thrilling piece to play and listen to.
