Rachmaninov penned a second piano sonata in 1913, but was ultimately unhappy
with it, prompting him to rework it in 1931. He argued that if Chopin could say
what he needed to say in 20 minutes with his sonata in the same key, he should
be able to as well. He ended up trimming the piece down, resulting in what many
would call a tighter, less verbose version.

This sonata has long been a recital and competition warhorse for the pianist,
and it's easy to see why. The piece takes you through the full spectrum of
shades from dark to light. The melancholy descending theme heard at the opening
permeates the entire piece; hardly a measure goes by without a hint of it.

00:00 — I. Allegro agitato  
08:30 — II. Non allegro—Lento  
14:46 — III. Allegro molto
