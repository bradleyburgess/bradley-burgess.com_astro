Howells is mostly known for his delicious sacred choral works, especially the
canticles (Magnificat & Nunc dimittis), but he penned a great number of
orchestral, keyboard, and chamber works. Some of his most beloved organ works
are the two sets of three “Psalm Preludes”, which are all based on a line from a
psalm.

Howells was never the same after his son, Michael's death in 1935. While this
first set of psalm preludes predates that tragedy by almost 20 years, one can
hear a foreshadowing of that melancholy atmosphere that pervades much of his
later output in this piece. The repeated-note figure of the opening really does
give us the impression of one walking “through the valley of the shadow of
death”.
