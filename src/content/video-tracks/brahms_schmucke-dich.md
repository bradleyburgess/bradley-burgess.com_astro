The _Eleven Chorale Preludes_ of Brahms are his last published opus (published
postumously), written at the end of his life. They are all based on Lutheran
chorales, and there is something of a Lenten theme to the collection. They were
written after the death of his friend, Clara Schumann, and he was likely aware
of his illness.

“Schmücke Dich”, though, is a communion hymn, the English translation often
having the title, “Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness”
