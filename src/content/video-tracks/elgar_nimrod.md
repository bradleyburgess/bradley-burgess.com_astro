Elgar's _Variations on an Original Theme_, often referred to as the “Enigma”
Variations have long been a symphonic favorite of audiences. The “Enigma” likely
refers to a hidden melody.

“Nimrod” has become a standalone piece, often played at British memorials.
According to Elgar, the opening bars contain a hint of the famous second
movement of Beethoven's _Pathetique Sonata_.
