Jacob Weber is active today as a composer, clinician and music editor. A
practicing church musician, his body of work includes a lot of liturgical organ
music. The three settings of _Antioch_ (“Joy to the World”) are a fun addition
to the Christmas organ repertoire. Here I present the first and last from the
set, which make for a great “introduction” and “toccata”. I've often used the
last movement as a postlude during Christmas time.
