This fiery setting of _O Come, O Come, Emmanuel_ reveals an influence of the
French organ school, especially noticeable in the toccata figures used in the
manuals. The sophisticated but accessible harmonic pallette and the clever use
of canon in the quieter middle section demonstrate Carter's compositional skill.

This is a seasonal favorite of mine, that I find an excuse to pull out every
Advent!
