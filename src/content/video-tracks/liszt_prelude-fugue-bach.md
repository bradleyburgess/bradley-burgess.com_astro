Unlike his vast body of piano music, Liszt's output for organ isn't very
extensive. This piece is one of my favorite recital pieces, though, as it
provides opportunity to really show off an organ's capabilities. Liszt gives
little to now registration indications, which I take as an opportunity to be
really creative.

Bach's name has long been used as a musical motiv, with the letters B-A-C-H
equating to the notes B♭-A-C-B♮ when using the German alphabet. The first four
notes in the opening pedal solo spell out this motiv, which is heard throughout
this rhapsodic showpiece.
