This piece has long been a Christmas favorite of organists. Purvis had a long
tenure at Grace Cathedral, and the Aeolian Skinner organ had a profound
influence on his composition. The “Purvis sound” had influences of theatre organ
playing, including the use of tremulants. This is heard in the opening very
clearly.

The piece takes us through Silent Night and Hark! the Herals, and ends with a
splendid toccata on O Come, All Ye Faithful.
