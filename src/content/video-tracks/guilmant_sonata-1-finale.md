This exciting conclusion to Guilmant's first Organ Sonata has long been a
favorite of organists and audiences alike. The music grabs you right from the
start, and doesn't relent. Even in the lyrical middle section, the toccata
figures from the opening interrupt the stillness. The concluding reprise of the
middle chorale — now triumphant — is thrilling. I've taken the liberty of adding
a little more of the solo tubas than perhaps what he calls for at the end, but I
think it's effective. One of my absolute favorite pieces to play.
