This is one of Bachâ€™s most famous organ preludes and fugues. The prelude is
rhapsodic and features toccata-like work on the manuals over a low, slow-moving
bass.

The 6/8 fugue is decided but dance-like. The pedal drops out in the middle
section, which allows for convenient change of color on a different manual. The
fugue draws to a close with an acceleration towards a virtuosic explosion.
