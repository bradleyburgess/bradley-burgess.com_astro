This piece from _33 Portraits, Op. 101_, is more conservative harmonically than
many of his other works, and indeed is neo-Baroque, as the caption “Alla Handel”
would lead us to believe.

Originally for the harmonium, this piece is often freely adapted by organists in
terms of manual changes and registration. I took Diane Bish's edition as a
starting point for my interpretation, and aimed to use as wide a color pallette
as possible.
