For Lent 2021 — during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic — I decided to do a
weekly improvised meditation. The church were I was serving was running a
virtual at-home series, with themes coming from various scripture passages.
This is one of those improvisations, based on the closing of Psalm 150: “Let
everything that has breath, praise The Lord.”

The piece is based on _Lobe den Herren_, Praise to the Lord the Almighty, and is
a driving, rhythmically-jagged flourish on the tune.
