In December of 2022, as we were emerging from the worst of the COVID-19
pandemic, I decided to embark on the adventure of learning and performing the
complete _Orgelbüchlein_ (“Little Organ Book”) of Johann Sebastian Bach over
the course of 2023. This project continued into 2024, and now I've decided to
record the complete set! Please watch the above video for more information and
to get a feel for the project.

The album will be produced under the
[RavenCD](https://www.ravencd.com/merchantmanager/index.php) label. To help
cover the costs of the recording, I ran an [Indiegogo fundraiser
campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bradley-burgess-the-orgelbuchlein#/),
which has now come to an end. We didn't quite reach the goal, however, and so
*I am still accepting donations via Venmo.* If you are able to contribute, your
donation would be much appreciated, and go directly towards covering the
project expenses: travel, accommodation, recording engineer, editing, and
physical production. (You can find a breakdown of expenses at the Indiegogo
page.)

Once the album has been released, it will be available for purchase (CD and
digital) and streaming on all major platforms.
