In December of 2022, as we were emerging from the worst of the COVID-19
pandemic, I decided to embark on the adventure of learning and performing the
complete _Orgelbüchlein_ (“Little Organ Book”) of Johann Sebastian Bach over
the course of 2023. This project continued into 2024, and — after a successfull
[Indiegogo campain](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bradley-burgess-the-orgelbuchlein#/) —
culminated in recording the complete collection for RavenCD.

## Update: January 7, 2024

Exciting news! The album is now available for purchase from
[RavenCD](https://ravencd.com/merchantmanager/product_info.php?products_id=381),
and in the coming days will be available to stream on all major platforms —
stay tuned.
