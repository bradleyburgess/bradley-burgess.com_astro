## Teaching.

I have over a decade of experience teaching the piano, the organ, music theory
and musicianship skills, and I would love to share that experience with you.

My teaching philosophy centers the student and their needs. No two students are
the same (even twins!), and every student has different aspirations, learning
styles, motivations, interests, and personalities. I tailor my teaching style
and what we cover to every student, considering their needs and goals.

Central to my approach is the principle of teaching the student, not the
subject. Therefore, the teacher-student relationship always comes first — before
deadlines, goals, or schedules.

I am currently offering support in these main areas, but always tailor
instruction to the individual needs; I’m happy to cover a variety of mixed
topics:

- **Organ:** Repertoire, service- and hymn-playing, transitioning to the organ
  from the piano, registration, creative hymn-playing (including creating your
  own reharmonizations and introductions)
- **Music Theory & Musicianship:** Harmony, ear training, analysis, basic
  conducting

I teach online and in-person; in-person lessons usually are held at Church of
the Nativity in North Raleigh, where I work. For online lessons, I am open to
doing regular “live” lessons, or asynchronous lessons: you record yourself, and
I send you a video and written feedback. I don't require any commitments, and am
happy to do once-off or short-term lessons.

  if we don't end up working together.
