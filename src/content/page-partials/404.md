# Yikes.

It seems you've managed to get somewhere unintended, or the link is broken. If
you have a minute, please [drop me a line](/?subject=Broken+link#section-contact) 
to let me know how you got here, and I'll try to fix it. That is, after you've read this haiku:

> Organs, and the word  
> "ominous". Both start with "o".  
> Coincidence? Nope.  
> <cite>â€” Lheticus</cite>
