  I had been playing the organ in church for years and wanted to learn more.
  Bradley has been patient and encouraging at every step along the way. He has
  been able to teach me techniques and tips that make playing the organ fun.
  Bradley's organ repertoire is impressive and his skill is amazing. He is the
  best instructor I have ever had.
